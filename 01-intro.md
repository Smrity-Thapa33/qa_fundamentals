# Introduction to QA, QC and Testing

## Quality Assurance (QA)

Quality Assurance (QA) is a process-oriented activity which ensures that no defects will be present in the software product from beginning of the software development process to the end. It is a preventive method since it mainly focuses on preventing the bugs and defects in the software product. A QA answers if the right things are done in the right way during software development. (QA = Preventing defects)

### Activities in QA include:
-	Defining standards and procedures for software development
-	Reviewing requirements and design documents
-	Conducting process audits
-	Preparing test plans and test strategies
-	Continuous process improvement

## Quality Control (QC)

Quality Control (QC) is a product-oriented activity which detects defects in the software before release to ensure quality.  It ensures that the actual software product matches expected requirements and software product is defect free. It is detective method. A QC answers whether the product meets the required quality standards or not. (QC = Detecting defects)

### Activities in QC include:

-	Manual testing of features and functionality
-	Verifying test cases and test scenarios
-	Performing functional, non-functional, regression, smoke testing
-	Logging bugs and defects
-	Checking if the product meets customer requirements

## Software Testing

Software Testing is the process of executing a program or application to find detects. It is a part of QC but sometimes used interchangeably with QC in common usage. It is action-oriented where the behavior of software is checked. (Testing = Checking for defects)

### Activities in Testing include:

-	Writing test cases and test scenarios
-	Executing test cases manually or using automation tools
-	Recording expected vs actual results
-	Reporting defects/bugs

## Why is Testing important?

Software testing is important because of following reasons:
1.	To find the defects before user do and avoid user complaints
2.	To ensure the software meets the requirements (features work according to requirements and business standards are correctly implemented) and user satisfaction (smooth experience, no crashes, correct results)
3.	To improve software quality by ensuring reliability, security, high performance, usability.
4.	To save time and cost (finding bugs early is much cheaper than fixing them later)
5.	To ensure security by identifying input validation issues, security vulnerabilities, unauthorized access risks, etc.
